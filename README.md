# Fordle
This is a clone of Wordle for those of us who don't feel like playing Wordle, but want to flex our knowledge of five-letter words with our friends. The live version is available [here](https://fordle-nine.vercel.app/). Simply click a statistic to edit the value. 

Each number on the statistics page is editable. Just click/tap on the number to change its value. If you update the total number of games played, the values for each number of guesses will be updated to a uniform random number such that all values add to the total number of games played. If a single guesses value is changed, the total number of games played will also be updated.
